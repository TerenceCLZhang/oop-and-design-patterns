# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and systems. These patterns deal primarily with how classes and objects can be combined to create more complex architectures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. Their key objective is to provide solutions to design problems related to object composition and structure, enabling better organisation, reusability, and maintainability of code.
Structural design patterns help to achieve several important goals:

Benefits include:

- Promoting code reusability by enabling common structures to be shared across different parts of a system. 
- Reducing coupling between components, so that changes in one area have minimal impact elsewhere. 
- Improving extensibility, allowing new functionality to be added with minimal modifications to existing code. 
- Enhancing clarity and maintainability by organising relationships between classes more explicitly.

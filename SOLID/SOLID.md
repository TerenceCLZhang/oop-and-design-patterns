# SOLID Principles

Used to create software that is maintainable, scalable, flexible, and robust, which leads to faster development, easier bug fixing, and simpler integration of new features over time.

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class or module should have only one reason to change.
- **O**: Open-closed Principle (OCP) - A class or module should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the program's correctness.
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - High level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
